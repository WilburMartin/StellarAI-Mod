# StellarAI

(Now reuploaded on a public Repo)

A modded AI pack for the strategy game Stellaris. This mod is a fork of [StarTech AI](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2494712590) and is meant to help the AI counter player Tech-rush and Pop-rush strategies by dynamically responding to player decisions. 


Changelog (0.32)
* Increased the weighting for research labs and research director-granting structures
* Changed the AI tech weighting to have it prioritize "snowballing" techs- technologies that increase research speed, increasing the speed by which new techs are gained.
* Slightly deprioritized military tech in early game.  
* Modified the military weightings to encourage the AI to form "Doomstacks" when facing human opponents- more annoying to deal with as the player, but much more dangerous than the current AI strategy of breaking into multiple ~20K fleets.
* Added a new script to track player tech level and respond accordingly.
